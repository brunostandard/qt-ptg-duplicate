PROGRAM NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Program as built with Qt (C++) Community Creator 5.12.2. 

- Program was part of final project submission. 

- Project was created for the UCLA PIC 10C Advanced Programming course.




INSTRUCTIONS---------------------------------------------------

Installation: Using Qt Community Creator 5.12.2, the application can be built with either
Desktop Qt 5.12.2 GCC 64-bit or MSV 2017 64-bit. The program will not run correctly otherwise.
Older versions of Qt Creator will not build the applicaiton at all due to the need of newest
libraries. 

Device Requirements: A decent computer is sufficient. Older computers will low CPU power may 
experience longer run-times due to the intense computational process of this application. 

Notes: The files cannot be re-ordered in another fashion as it is currently. The program algorithms
are local path specific. Furthermore, the png files cannot be re-named for the similar reasons. 

Suggestions: Run the application in full window for best user experience.
